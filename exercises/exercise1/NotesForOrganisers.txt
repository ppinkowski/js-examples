This exercise should take about 1 1/2 hours.

People were commonly becoming stuck on small areas in parts 1-3. If they haven't got that far in 15-20 mins then give then some help,
otherwise they will not have enough time to complete the rest of the exercise (part 4 is the most interesting/challenging part anyway).
